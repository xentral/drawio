<h1>Sales Order</h1>
<p>The Sales Order is the central document in Xentral that manifests a sale event and serves as the starting point for
    all subsequent processes such as fulfillment, invoicing, reservations, etc.</p>
<p>Sales Orders can be preceded by Offers, which are non-binding documents that are used to present
    products and prices to customers.</p>
