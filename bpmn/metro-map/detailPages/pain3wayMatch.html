<h1>Current shortcomings in the Procure-2-Pay process</h1>
<p>Xentral has a very rudimentary functionality to reconcile purchased goods against delivered goods and invoiced goods
    (3-way match).</p>
<p>While it is possible to load product positions and quantities from the purchase order / the associated goods receipt,
    the reconciliation process involves a lot of manual comparisons and the UI does not prevent user errors.</p>
