<h1>Current issues in Delivery Handover</h1>
<p>Our delivery handover is currently causing severe performance issues in many customer instances.</p>
<p>A joint task force has been formed between FFU, SPS and SRE analysing root causes and implementing improvements to our logic. </p>
<p>Key steps are:
<ul>

        <li class="task done"><b>Carve out unnecessary database queries:</b> fetch data once and persist in PHP variables rather than fetching over and over </li>
        <li class="task wip"><b>Move non-time critical actions to worker queues</b> instead of doing everything synchronously</li>
        <li class="task"><b>Indroduce pre-checks</b> to only calculate every sales order when stock is low</li>
        <li class="task"><b>Introduce stock allocation table</b> which persists previously allocated quantities and allows for quick and cheap updates based on sales order and/or product</li>


</ul></p>
